# photo-gallery
This project is about creating a responsive photo gallery using CSS Grid. CSS Grid is ideal for this purpose because it allows for complex, flexible, and efficient grid layouts.

## Interactivity:
Each image can be clicked to show a larger version or more details via a modal view if needed.

## Optimized Loading:
Lazy loading can be implemented to improve performance, especially useful when handling a large number of images.

## Custom Styling:
Custom CSS styles enhance the gallery’s appearance, ensuring it aligns with the visual identity of the website.

# Technologies Used:
